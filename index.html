        <div class="txt-div">
            <p>This is python project made from the tutorials of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@redhen/" target="_blank">Red Hen Dev</a> who is a nice youtuber who makes such python tutorials!<br>This game works in ursina engine.<br> I made this about 2 years ago in my summer holidays to practice and learn something new in python.<br> I have my special interests in Minecraft and coding and so I tried to mix both of them! But from the begining, I have worked on non 3D stuff more than the 3D enviorenment this game is made in... Which is why I followed a few episodes of this nice youtuber and at the end, he managed to help me a lot!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I request ya'll to have a look at his channel, he makes good content, even though he has stopped uploading these days but his previous videos help too!</p>
